# A-Demonstration-of-K-means-Clustering-and-Principal-Component-Analysis-Machine-Learning-

Machine learning has brought about advancements in technology and contribution to research across several fields and for that they have become increasingly important in the financial sector with their use not limited to only developing effective trading strategies and gaining a competitive edge but also for performing a variety of tasks, research and analysis. In this handbook, we aim to provide thoughtful guidelines for implementing different Machine learning techniques as well as addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by various machine learning techniques.

** K-means Clustering**

K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm which organizes unlabeled data points into groups (clusters) where data points with similar attributes belong exclusively to the same cluster and are dissimilar to data points belonging to other groups. K-means is an exclusive partitioning method, that is, it organizes the data points into groups such that each data point belongs solely to a single cluster. The algorithm is iterative and centroid-based, partitioning a dataset into similar groups based on the distance between their centroids with the objective of minimizing the sum of distances between the data points and their cluster centroids. 
K-means employs a distance metric as the determinant for the similarity and dissimilarity between data points and this in turns influences the shape of the clusters formed. According to (Banoula, 2024), K-meansâ€™ design allows for the use of different distance metrics with some being Euclidean distance measure, Manhattan distance measure, squared euclidean distance measure and the Cosine distance measure. The euclidean distance is a measure of an ordinary straight line between two points, in this case the data point and the centroid.
K-means can be used for Market segmentation, customer segmentation, anomaly detection, fraud detection among others.
